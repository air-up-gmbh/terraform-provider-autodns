## Schema

### Required

- `origin` (String) Zone's domain name.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Zone ID. This is generated by the terraform provider due to the lack of IDs in the API response.The format of the ID generated by the provider is 'zoneOrigin@zoneVirtualNameServer' and it can be safely used as an input for 'zone_id' when it's required by the other provider resources.
- `name_server_group` (String) The nameserver group attached to the zone.
- `virtual_name_server` (String) The zone's virtual name server.
